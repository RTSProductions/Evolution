# Info
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>
  
 This is an  evolution simulation made in unity with c# where populations can evolve and go extinct.

Inspired by [Sebastian Lague's video on simulating an ecosystem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_It_X7v-1E&t=0s) And yes the bunny, fox, and plant models are made to look like the models he has because i had no idea how to make something diferent so i just remade them
